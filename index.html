            <h3>Meeting Black Singles: Join a Dating Site with a Difference</h3>
            <h5>We understand that in these busy times it can be difficult to meet someone who shares your interests, background and goals. EliteSingles is therefore designed to allow you to make the best use of your time. Our smart-profiling service is based
                on two main factors: an in-depth personality test and your partner preferences. The personality test gives us an overview of who you are and what’s important to you – for example religion, lifestyle, habits and location. This questionnaire
                is based on the “Five Factor Model” of personality traits, a concept central to modern psychology since the 1980s; you can also access the results at any time in your profile under “personality profile”. Our dating agency then takes these
                results and combines them with your personal preferences in order to send you 3-7 suitable matches per day. Control of your preferences is completely in your hands and can be adjusted at any time. If, for example, the desire to have children
                or a shared cultural background are very important to you it will be reflected in the potential partners we send. So you know that the singles you’re in contact with are compatible with both your personality and lifestyle. Plus, you can
                search through additional profiles using our 'Have you met...' feature as and when you have more time. EliteSingles offers a premium choice, differentiating ourselves from other black dating services, with our matchmaking method to attract
                the very best black singles to our site. Ready to meet someone great? Give yourself the best chance at long-lasting love and sign up to EliteSingles today!</h5>

            <h5 class="bdtt">According to The Washington Post, who analyzed data from a Stanford University and University of California in Santa Barbara study about successful dates, both men and women feel more connected to their date when they indicate sincere and
                candid opinions. The study showed that men felt less connected to a woman when she gave vague answers to questions and indicated that responses like ‘kind of’ and ‘maybe’ were a huge put off. Surprisingly, the data revealed that women
                felt more connected to men when they were interrupted by them because it demonstrated that the man was actually paying attention to what they were saying.</h5>
